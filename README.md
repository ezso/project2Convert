# project2Convert
A simple image editor
The name of this project is inspired by the open source project convert, a command line tool for image manipulation. As the original convert project contains very extensive work, the version you have to implement only
covers a fraction of convertâ€™s features. The selected tasks are 1) reading and writing images, 2) simple image
manipulation e.g. rotating an image and 3) performing a flood fill operation you may know as the paint bucket
tool in image editing software like Photoshop, GIMP or Microsoft Paint.
